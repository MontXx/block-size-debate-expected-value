Even decisions that are very valid in the eyes of "the economic majority" deserve careful questioning.

For the Wizards approach, if a minimal blockchain slashes capacity of home users, certain adverse outcomes become more likely. For XT, if a larger blockchain slashes home users of full nodes, still other adverse outcomes become more likely.

The purpose of this spreadsheet is to document what are the adverse outcomes, for BitcoinXT (**XT**) and Bitcoin Core (**Wizards**) also.

XT is a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol in two ways. First, XT hard forks the block size, which is pretty clear. Second, and more crucially, XT strong-arms Bitcoin developers out of the decision making hierarchy, as all Bitcoin Core developers save Gavin Andresen have publicly taken stances opposing BitcoinXT.

So that decision makers can better understand the risks, I've created an open source spreadsheet for the Expected Value of both sides in the block size debate. There could be third and forth sides, or more. Create pull requests or just advertise your own fork of this repo to the public and make your point.

For simplicity, one fork of Bitcoin Core is called **BitcoinXT**, which is described as a Bitcoin with bigger blocks, and the other is called **Wizards**, which is Bitcoin Core as it stands today.
